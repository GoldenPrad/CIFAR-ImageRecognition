# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This repository contains code for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Training the Model

### Preparing the Data
 - 

### Building the Network
 - 

### Compiling and Training the Model
 - 


## Testing the Model

### Basic Testing
 - Ensuring the model was working properly against test data sset as well as outside images.
   
### Test 1
 - Running a square image of a frog, or an airplane or any of the other classes through the network, and seeing what it returns.

### Test 2
 - Running a randomly generated image through the network to view any bias with what it predicts.

### Test 3
 - Testing the network with some random images from the test_images set.
